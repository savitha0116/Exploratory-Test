                         The difference between Experience Based Testing and Formal Testing
1. Experience-Based Testing
- Relies on the tester's experience, intuition, and knowledge of the system.
- Informal approach, no strict documentation or planning.
- Testers use their expertise to identify potential issues and create test scenarios.
- Focuses on exploratory testing, where testers explore the system without pre-conceived notions.

2. Formal Testing
- Structured approach, following a predefined plan and documentation.
- Testing is based on documented requirements, specifications, and test cases.
- Testers follow a set of predefined steps to validate the system's functionality.
- Focuses on verifying the system's functionality against specified requirements.
